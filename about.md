Hi, I'm Jaysen an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Indonesia.

This is a personal blog where I share CTF write-ups and what I learn along the way
as a Computer Science student.

Most of the content here focuses on explaining the thought process, techniques,
and investigation steps behind each challenge, rather than just presenting the
final solution.
